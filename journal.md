If you were in charge of your school, what would your technology and AI policy be? Think about things like cell phones, Chromebooks, AI tools (like ChatGPT), and online games. Should games be blocked, or should certain ones (like math or learning games) be allowed? In 5–7 sentences, explain your rules and why you think they would make school better.
If was in charge of the school techlogy and AI poicy I would balanced technology  policy  that helps students learn  while minimizing distractions. Cell phones would be  allowed but  kept in "focus mode"  during  class time students could  use them for educational apps and  research but  soical media  would be blocked during school hours. For AI tools like chat GBT , I'd allow them  for brainstorming and research but require students to clearly cite when they  use Ai assistance, teaching them  to be honest  about their sources.Chromebooks would have  educational  games and coding platforms available during  free time,but entertainment games would be blocked during class periods. I'd also have tech-free times like lunch where students can choose to soicalize without screens.This policy would teach students to use technology  as a powerful learning tool while  developing  self-control and digital  citizenship skill they'll need for life.

My prompt was designed to create a understanding educational platform that would teach high school students basketball fundamentals through structured modules, interactive quizzes, and progress tracking, with an academic tone suitable for serious learning. Canva Code interpreted this by building a full-featured learning management system with five detailed instructional modules (dribbling, passing, shooting, defense, and strategy), each containing rich educational content, visual diagrams, and knowledge assessments.

The interactive elements that worked best were the progress tracking system that visually shows completion status, the immediate feedback mechanism in quizzes that provides explanations for both correct and incorrect answers, and the modular structure that allows students to learn at their own pace while building toward a comprehensive final assessment. The quiz system particularly excelled with its smooth animations, clear visual feedback, and educational explanations that reinforce learning.

For future improvements, I could enhance the prompt by requesting more m elements like interactive court diagrams where students can click to identify positions, or simulation exercises where they practice decision-making in game scenarios. I would also specify the need for adaptive learning paths that adjust difficulty based on quiz performance, and perhaps include peer collaboration features where students can discuss strategies or share their progress with teammates.

Cameras will not be dected flashing red lights or the Ai might not be correted. Also cars will be a challenge could be cars because of the software to try to protize traffic flow or lane data.If If I was the programmer I would use visual pattern learing using bus stop senarios. I would add a rule to the bus flashing red lights in traffic stuations . Using cross check system  cameras and radar allowing the car to proceeed.
