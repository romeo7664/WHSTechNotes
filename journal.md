Should games be blocked, or should certain ones (like math or learning games) be allowed? In 5–7 sentences, explain your rules and why you think they would make school better.
If was in charge of the school techlogy and AI poicy I would balanced technology  policy  that helps students learn  while minimizing distractions. Cell phones would be  allowed but  kept in "focus mode"  during  class time students could  use them for educational apps and  research but  soical media  would be blocked during school hours. For AI tools like chat GBT , I'd allow them  for brainstorming and research but require students to clearly cite when they  use Ai assistance, teaching them  to be honest  about their sources.Chromebooks would have  educational  games and coding platforms available during  free time,but entertainment games would be blocked during class periods. I'd also have tech-free times like lunch where students can choose to soicalize without screens.This policy would teach students to use technology  as a powerful learning tool while  developing  self-control and digital  citizenship skill they'll need for life.
